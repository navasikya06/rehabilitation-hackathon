# Rehabilitation project

This repo contains all the code we produced during the hackathon from Navigator Group and Big Data Society (Macquarie University).

The challenge was to execute insurance cost prediction and fitness for work score for patients at each time point.

Our solution included a Jupyter notebook and Sreamlit code for a mock up of the web interface.
