# Rehabilitation project

This repo contains all the code we produced during the hackathon from Navigator Group and Big Data Society (Macquarie University).

The challenge was to predict insurance cost and fitness for work score for patients at each check point. 

Our solution included a Jupyter notebook and Streamlit code for a mock up of the web interface. 

- Classification problem: Logistic regression with PCA has highest accuracy
- Regression problem: XGBoost has lowest MSE

To run the Streamlit app for demo, install all of the dependencies in "requirements.txt" and run "Streamlit run app.py" in your terminal.
